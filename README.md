# Universal-Monitoring-System
Universal Monitoring System (UMS) was a research topic under Horticulture Innovation Lab Regional Center at Kasetsart University (2018-2019). Under the research, there are 2 models: online version, and offline version.

Objective and usage
Agriculture depends on environment conditions over time. Monitoring the environmental condition surrounding plants, orchard or research field is the key to understanding the responce of plants to the environment. UMS was designed to have several environmental sensors in one main unit. User can choose which sensors will be in the system or not by their needs and cost. UMS was design to have 2 same environmental sensors to compare between 2 conditions such as outside and inside the greenhouse. Data were saved in to SD card at specific interval. 
Online UMS helps user to monitor their crops anywhere in the world. Data also save in the sever for download at any time.
